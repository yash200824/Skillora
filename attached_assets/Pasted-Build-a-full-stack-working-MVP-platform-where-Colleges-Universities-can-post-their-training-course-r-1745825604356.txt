Build a full-stack working MVP platform where Colleges/Universities can post their training/course requirements and Freelance Trainers/Vendors can apply, get selected, conduct the training sessions, and receive ratings and payment.

The system must have the following features:

🔵 1. Authentication Module
Register/Login for:

College Users

Trainer Users

Admin Users

JWT-based authentication

Password hashing with bcrypt

Role-based access control (College, Trainer, Admin)

🔵 2. User Dashboards
College Dashboard:

Post new Training Requirements

View Applications

Shortlist & Accept Trainers

Manage Trainings

Trainer Dashboard:

Create/Update Profile

Browse Open Trainings

Apply for Trainings

View Accepted Trainings

Admin Dashboard:

Approve or Reject Trainer Profiles

Block/Unblock Users

View Platform Statistics

🔵 3. Training/Project Management
College can Post Trainings (Title, Description, Skills Required)

Trainers can Apply to Trainings

College can Shortlist & Accept Trainers

Status Management (Open, In Progress, Completed)

🔵 4. Contract Management (MVP)
Generate a simple contract once a trainer is accepted

Include Course Title, Fee, Deliverables, Digital Acceptance

Save contract acceptance date

🔵 5. Reviews & Rating System
After training completion:

College rates Trainer

Trainer rates College

Rating from 1 to 5 stars with comments

🔵 6. Payments (MVP Simulation)
Manual Confirmation (no real gateway yet)

"Mark as Paid" button after training completed

Future upgrade ready for Stripe/Razorpay integration

🔵 7. Notifications (MVP)
In-app notifications when applications are received, shortlisted, or accepted

Optional: Setup simple SMTP Email Alerts later

⚙️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js + TailwindCSS

Backend: Node.js + Express.js

Database: PostgreSQL

Authentication: JWT + Bcrypt

ORM: Sequelize.js or Prisma

Hosting: Replit Deploy / Vercel

📄 Basic ReadMe Instructions
Install frontend and backend dependencies

Setup environment variables (JWT_SECRET, DB_URL, etc.)

Run migrations to set up tables

Start backend server on port 5000

Start frontend server on port 3000

Connect both using Axios from frontend

Deploy using Replit Deploy or Vercel

🧠 Important Points for Replit AI
Build backend and frontend separately first, then integrate.

Add clear comments in the codebase for scalability.

Keep styling minimal and clean for MVP.

Prioritize working features over fancy UI initially.

Make project ready for adding real payments, video calls, or AI recommendations later.

🎯 Final Objective:
Build a fully functional MVP of a Trainer–College Marketplace Platform that connects freelance trainers to colleges for academic training projects with full user management, project management, and rating system, ready for future scaling!
